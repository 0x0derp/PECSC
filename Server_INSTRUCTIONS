so if you want to run a server, it takes some setting up:

you need to install pyopenssl (sudo apt-get install python-pyopenssl)

Generate Private Key/Cert (commandline):

openssl genrsa 1024 > key
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -sha1 -days 365 -key key > cert

that's pretty much it, if theres anything else ill add it here later
