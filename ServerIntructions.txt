ok so now running a server is pretty easy:

sudo python pecsc_Server.py

You'll be prompted for ip and port to run the server on

now here's a drawback to this server code:

you have to answer another prompt for number of clients, so whatever number you put in, the server has to wait until that many people connect to the server to begin the main server loop

so if anyone has any ideas on how to fix this problem, submit a pull request!
