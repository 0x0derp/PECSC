ok so here are some simple intructions on setting up your client:

open terminal
navigate to pecsc_Client.py's directory
type "sudo python pecsc_Client.py"

now enter the IP and HOST of the server you're connecting to

if your connection is successful:
GUI should pop up

put your username (handle) in the first box, then whenever you feel like chatting:
type your stuff in the bottom text box, and click the "Send" button

keep an eye on the terminal, becuase that is where you will see other user's chat
